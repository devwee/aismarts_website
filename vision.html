                <h2>The Future We're Building</h2>
                <p>We envision a world where powerful AI-driven insights aren't locked away in corporate boardrooms or available only to those with deep technical expertise. Instead, they're accessible to everyone, in the moments that matter most.</p>
                <p>From pricing an asset to making relationship decisions, from career choices to lifestyle changes — these are the decisions that shape our lives. Yet too often, people make them with incomplete information, conflicting advice, or no data at all.</p>
                <p>Aismarts exists to change that.</p>
